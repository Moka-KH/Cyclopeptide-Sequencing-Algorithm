# Cyclopeptide-Sequencing-Algorithm

Given an ideal experimental spectrum, this algorithm finds a cyclic peptide whose theoretical spectrum matches the experimental spectrum. 
- Given: A collection of (possibly repeated) integers Spectrum corresponding to an  ideal experimental spectrum, [Theoretical Spectrum]
- Return: All the linear representations of the cyclic sequence of the protein (Peptide Sequence)
